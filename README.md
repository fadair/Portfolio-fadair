During my degree I specialised in biogeography by completing field-based research on soil–tree interactions at Coed Felenrhyd/Llennyrch rainforest in Wales and on erosion processes in Spain’s Las Salinas Badlands. As a GIS Consultant I produce deliverables for numerous cross-disciplinary projects that often have conflicting deadlines which means liaising with project managers, experts, consultants, and clients. I have extensive experience working to manage large, complex, and non-standard datasets to support innovative work spanning infrastructure and conservation projects, from local to regional scales.
